<h2> Hobbies and Interests</h2> <!-- i think it is importnat for every resume to have a hobbies and interests paragraph I think this is a better way to get to know someone thatn just what their education says about them-->
<p> I do have some hobbies that have shapped who I am as an adult and continue to inspire my more creative side, these include clubs like durham Attack a youth volleyball
association, that got me through public and highschool. Also the 4-H which helped to make me a well rounded and contributing member of society,
along with making me more connected withthe agricultural community for a lifetime. And finally a more recent hobby crochet and knitting which I 
picked up during the pandemic years as a way to productivly pass the time inside. </p>
